# python-oop-review

## Overview

**python-oop-review** is a Python console application designed to illustrate the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a process simulation. The project implements a simple compilation pipeline—converting a source file (`main.c`) into an executable (`main.exe`)—to demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. A `Process` manages a sequence of `Task` objects (e.g., scanning, parsing, static analysis, code generation, linking), utilizing resources like `Consumable` Memory and `Usable` CPU.

## Purpose

The primary goal of `python-oop-review` is educational: to provide a practical example of OOP principles in Python through a process simulation. It serves as a learning tool for developers to explore:
- **Encapsulation**: Data and behavior are bundled within classes (e.g., `Resource`, `Task`).
- **Inheritance**: Classes like `ConsumableResource` and `UsableResource` inherit from `Resource`.
- **Polymorphism**: Abstract methods (e.g., `execute`) allow runtime behavior variation.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract base classes (`Resource`, `Executable`) define interfaces.

## Features

- **OOP Demonstration**: Showcases encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in Python.
- **Modular Design**: Classes are organized in separate files within the `src/` directory.
- **Process Simulation**: Models a compilation pipeline with realistic tasks and resource management.
- **Resource Types**: Includes `ConsumableResource` (depletes) and `UsableResource` (reusable).
- **Exception Handling**: Simple error handling for resource allocation and execution.
- **Documentation**: Detailed docstrings for classes, attributes, and methods.
